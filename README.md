# Ginger_disease_detection

Ginger is one among the others which are affected by disease caused by bacteria, fungi, and virus being bacterial wilt is the most determinant constraint to ginger production. Detection of the disease needs special attention from experts which is not possible for mass production. However, the state-of-the-art technology can deploy to overcome the problem by means of image processing in a mass cultivates ginger crop. To this end, a deep learning approach for early ginger disease detection from the leaf is proposed through different phases after collecting 7,014 ginger images with the help of domain experts from different farms. The collected data passed through different image pre-processing to design and develop a deep learning model that can detect and classify with a different scenario. 

Here I conducted different experiment among those you can see the following approach
1. Detecting ginger disease by using convolutional neural network (CNN)
2. detecting ginger disease by using pre trained model(Mobile Net)

Anyone using this data is required to cite the following papers.
